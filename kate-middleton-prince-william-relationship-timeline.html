"When I first met Kate, I knew there was something very special about her, and then I knew there was possibly something I wanted to explore there, but we ended up being friends for a while," <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince William</a> explained during the couple's now-famous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2010 engagement interview</a> with Tom Bradby of ITV News.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As it turned out, it was the strong bond they formed as friends that made their union so solid. "That was a good sort of foundation," William said. "I do genuinely believe now that being friends with [each other] is a massive advantage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the pair dated for much of their college careers, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>took a break</a> following graduation for some self-exploration. "I at the time wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person," Kate said in the couple's engagement interview. "You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realized — I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger — and I really valued that time for me, as well."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Rowland - Pool/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They didn't stay apart for long, however, reuniting in the summer of 2007 with a series of secret dates. Three years later, they announced their engagement to the world, and by 2011, they had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>officially tied the knot</a> with a fairy tale ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a friend of the pair, the couple's marriage is an "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>old-fashioned" one</a>. "They look after each other but in different ways," the friend told PEOPLE of their relationship. Explained another source in 2012, "[Kate] brings a sense of ordinariness that William has always craved."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also made the prince a father. Kate and William share three children: <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince George</a>, born in 2013, <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Princess Charlotte</a>, born in 2015 and <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Prince Louis</a>, born in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to relive all their biggest relationship milestones, from their chummy beginnings to their unified work as royals.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2001-kate-middleton-and-prince-william-meet-at-college></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>2001: Kate Middleton and Prince William meet at college</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pool/Anwar Hussein Collection/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate and William first laid eyes on each other while studying at St. Andrews University. According to Kate, it took some time for the two to get to know each other, in part due to her bashfulness. "I think you said I actually went bright red when I met you and sort of scuttled off," she recounted to <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince William</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>during their 2010 engagement interview</a>. "[I was] feeling very shy about meeting you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From there, however, the pair became "very close friends." "We were friends for over a year first," William said in the same interview.
